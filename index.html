        <p class="lead mb-4">As a California native, a being a Moreno Valley Resident my entire life, I think it's appropriate that I help the City that molded me. I graduated from Moreno Valley High School in 2019, being a part of Varsity Baseball and actively participating in AP Classes my Junior and Senior Year, trying to make a mark on my Highschool Academic journey. As I wasn't the best in my first two years, but made up for it, my University offers were quite extensive. Ranging from the Cornhuskers of University of Nebraska - Lincoln, to the Northen Wildcats of Chico State, I had a lot of options. Choosing to stick to my home team, I applied to the University of California - Riverside, joining their College of Hummanities - History Department<br><br>

        Similar to the Highschool scene, my first two years were not too hot, with the implication of COVID-19 on the campus and an unknown disability, my academics suffered greatly. While my Academics suffered, my inner blue collar worker was striving. Having previously worked at Harkins Movie Theatre and being layed off due to COVID, I swapped my work mode from movies to coffee, working at a local coffee shop named "Cupcake and Espresso Bar". This work experience was a little different from a movie theater, but in a good way. It allowed me to find a community and friends that make life a whole lot better, especially being able to find a person I can call my brother in all seriousness. This experience also allowed me to open a few other doors of oppurtunity, having the experience to be a baker and manager gives a lot of cooperating skills that help in any kind of workplace. <br><br>

        Having outgrown the business I called my own, and feeling too cornered by my environment, I took a leap of faith into one of the unexpected doors of oppurtunity. Having the Mayor as a common customer allows for a lot of conversations and small talk not a lot of folks can have. Earning their trust and recognition gave me the chance to work in their office as an intern; and while using my charisma, social and work ethic, as well as my knowledge of Office Politics I was able to interview and be promoted to the Administration Assistant role. Being in the Office environment molds me to put my first foot forward in all aspects, which helped me revive my Academic Career, going from a sub 1.0 GPA to a solid 2.1 GPA that is only ever increasing. Being dedicated to the grind and having a working environment that establishes that mindset is helpful, giving me a lot of differnt avenues to choose from.
